## 🚀 What I do
- **Backend development** focused on reliability, observability, and “it doesn’t break in prod” energy  
- **AI-enabled workflows** (automation, orchestration, and practical use-cases, not just demos)
- **API integrations** end-to-end: auth, webhooks, retries, pagination, rate limits, error handling  
- Experience integrating with tools like **Box (Cloud Storage)**, **Salesforce**, **Dialpad**, and project/ops platforms

---

## 🧰 Tech I use
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Apex  
**Web:** HTML, CSS  
**Strengths:** API design/integration, automation, debugging, production support

> I’m not married to a stack, I’m married to shipping solutions.

## 🧪 Featured project
### 🏠 Casa Home Lab (CasaOS)
A personal homelab setup where I experiment with automation, services, and self-hosting. Now I’m building toward **home-lab AI**.

**Highlights:**
- Self-hosted services + server management
- Automation and monitoring mindset (because guessing is not a strategy)
- A playground for backend + AI experiments

---

## 🌱 What I’m learning next
### 🤖 Home Lab AI
I’m working toward running AI tools and workflows inside my homelab, focusing on practical, useful automation.

## 🎮 Outside of coding
When I’m not building things, I’m probably:
- gaming 🎮  
- painting 🎨  
- or at the gym 🏋️
