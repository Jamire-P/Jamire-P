## 🧪 Project Highlights

### 🤖 AI-Powered Metadata Scanner (Work Project | Veterans Guardian)
Using Box's cloud storage and event monitoring, directly on upload, we use AI to scan documents and apply metadata.

**Highlights:**
- Real Time Monitoring
- AI Metadata extraction and application
- Statistical reporting and self-monitoring.

### 🏠 Home Lab (Personal Project)
A personal homelab setup where I experiment with automation, services, and self-hosting. Now I’m building toward **home-lab AI**.

**Highlights:**
- Self-hosted services + server management
- Automation and monitoring mindset (because guessing is not a strategy)
- A playground for backend + AI experiments

## 📚 What I’m learning next
### 🤖 Home Lab AI
I’m working toward running AI tools and workflows inside my homelab, focusing on practical, useful automation.
